# TOY-ORGAN
Toy which can also be used to produce some kind of music

HERE I have used NE555 TIMER, SPEAKER, SWITCHES, RESISTANCES, LCD DISPLAY
 
 when we simulate the crkt and close any of the switch, a different frequency of sound produced for different switches.
 Now it is like a toy , but if we replace the switches by a key(like in keyboard/ piano), then it can be used to produce different compositions of music (sounds of different frequency) very easily, bcz in switches we have to do both ON and OFF but in case of keys if we release it it automatically becomes off.
